Disclaimer

This software is meant to be a productive contribution to the rapidly growing AI-generated media industry. It will help artists with tasks such as animating a custom character or using the character as a model for clothing etc.

The developers of this software are aware of its possible unethical applications and are committed to take preventative measures against them. It has a built-in check which prevents the program from working on inappropriate media including but not limited to nudity, graphic content, sensitive material such as war footage etc. We will continue to develop this project in the positive direction while adhering to law and ethics.

How do I install it?
Basic: It is more likely to work on your computer but it will also be very slow. You can follow instructions for the basic install (This usually runs via CPU)
1.Setup your platform

    python (3.10 recommended)
    pip
    git
    ffmpeg
    visual studio 2022 runtimes (windows)

2. Clone Repository

https://github.com/fixercracker/Deep-Live-Cam-by-fx.git

3. Download Models

    GFPGANv1.4
    inswapper_128_fp16.onnx

Then put those 2 files on the "models" folder
4. Install dependency

We highly recommend to work with a venv to avoid issues.

pip install -r requirements.txt

DONE!!! If you dont have any GPU, You should be able to run roop using python run.py command. Keep in mind that while running the program for first time, it will download some models which can take time depending on your network connection.
*Proceed if you want to use GPU Acceleration
